## Project Overview
`Project Overview`
An AI assistant designed to streamline document management for Heritage Squareâ€™s Google Drive. The AI retrieves, organizes, and tags documents, improving accuracy and saving time for staff involved in marketing, operations, and grants via giving ability to .

`Impact for Non-Profits`
The organization has thousands of files in Google Drive, making it difficult to find the correct file containing relevant information. Our solution provides a chatbot-like interface to interact with all the documents on Google Drive. It also adds links to the files at the bottom, allowing users to access more detailed information when needed.

## Features
1. Automated File Retrieval: Fetches documents from Google Drive using a Google service account.
2. Document Vectorization: Uses OpenAI to convert documents into vector embeddings for efficient querying.
3. Intelligent Querying: Responds to user queries by retrieving relevant documents based on vectorized content.

## Future Improvements
1. File Categories based on high-level categories.
2. Implementation of reorganization and sorting features based on parameters like creation date.
3. Auto-sorting of images (historic vs non-historic).
4. Move Agent Implementation to Langgraph
